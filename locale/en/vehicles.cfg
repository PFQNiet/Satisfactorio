[entity-description]
tractor=25 slot inventory. Can be automated to pick up and deliver resources at Truck Stations. Nicknamed the Sugarcube by FICSIT pioneers.
truck=48 slot inventory. Can be automated to pick up and deliver resources at Truck Stations. Nicknamed the Unit by FICSIT pioneers.
explorer=24 slot inventory. Fast and nimble exploration vehicle.
truck-station=Either send or receive resources to vehicles. Has an inventory with 48 slots. Transfers up to 120 stacks per minute to/from docked vehicle. Always refuels vehicles if it has access to a matching fuel type.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Power is consumed only when a vehicle is in the loading bay.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Input/output are blocked when a vehicle is present.[/color][/font]\n__CONTROL__rotate__: Toggle load/unload
train-station=Locomotives can be set to drive and stop at the train station.\nLoading/unloading takes 25 seconds.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Provides power to incoming trains.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Electric locomotive consumption:[/color][/font] 25-110 MW
freight-platform=Freight cars that stop at the platform will be loaded or unloaded. Has an inventory with 48 slots. Transfers up to 80 stacks per minute to/from docked wagon.\nNeeds to be connected to a powered train station to function.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Power is consumed only when a wagon is in the loading bay.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Input/output are blocked when a wagon is present.[/color][/font]\n__CONTROL__rotate__: Toggle load/unload
fluid-freight-platform=Freight cars that stop at the platform will be loaded or unloaded. Has storage for 2,400m³. Transfers up to 4,000m³ per minute to/from docked wagon.\nNeeds to be connected to a powered train station to function.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Power is consumed only when a wagon is in the loading bay.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Input/output are blocked when a wagon is present.[/color][/font]\n__CONTROL__rotate__: Toggle load/unload
empty-platform=An empty train platform, for when a particular car should be left alone at that station.
locomotive=Moves Freight Cars from station to station. Must be built on railway. Nicknamed Leif by FICSIT pioneers.
cargo-wagon=32 slot inventory. Can be loaded or unloaded at Freight Platforms.
fluid-wagon=1,600m³ capacity. Can be loaded or unloaded at Fluid Freight Platforms.
drone-port=2×18 slot inventory. Drone ports can be assigned one other port as their transport destination. Each Drone port can contain a single Drone, which transports available input back and forth between its home and destination port.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. consumption:[/color][/font] 100 MW
drone=9 slot inventory. Must be built on a Drone port. Requires Batteries as fuel, based on travel distance. Refuels at any port, if able.
